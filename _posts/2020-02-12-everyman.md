That woman was soaked in tears
Crippled by her many fears
All she could do was cry
She was told she will soon die
Called on a journey that needed no fare
Yet there seemed to be none to care

That man was drenched in sweat
His mounting needs were never met
His ugly feet were covered with sore
He was said to always want more
Saddled with responsibility that weighed
Yet little or no income seemed to be made

That girl was stained with blood 
Hunger n thirst proved to her a flood
Her interest were not in frivolity 
Them waves swept her off into immorality
Enticed by the promise of a sumptuous meal
But he forcefully unlocked the seal

That boy was covered in scar
His pressing needs seemed to push him far
He never had enough to eat
Twas said to start from a stolen meat
But as he grew there were more needs 
Scars was when he was caught in dem deeds

That gentleman was incapacitated. 
Couldn't help but feel frustrated 
His sweats never seemed to dry up
Yet nothing seemed to fill his cup
How he strived to be better
The scorching sun only made him wetter

That lady was exasperated
She could only feel exhausted 
Her job was indeed so tasking
But her wealth was not basking
Family and friends with their expectations 
She was left to suffer the many perforations 

That old woman was lost in thought 
Remembered how well she fought
For her children, she did fight 
And suffered many sleepless night
Now her children were nowhere to be found 
Not looking back as tho bound

That old man was fragile nd weak 
His old age constantly making him sick
His youth days bidded him bye
Left to keep wondering why
Sometimes wished to be dead
But his friend was none but his bed
