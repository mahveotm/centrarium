What can make a strong man weak?
What can turn on the angel in him and turn off the beast?
What can stop his wise reasoning ?
What can make him speak gibberish?

I know of this answer but I won't tell you yet.
Is it food, love or wealth; place your bet.
Think deeply or you could just close your eyes and guess.
My clue for you is that he becomes strange; no more, no less.

When a wise man do awkward things, know he suffers from this disease.
When a strong man refuses to fight henceforth, there is a reason he really wants peace.

Love is the reason that makes him cry like a baby.
Especially when he sees that rare pretty lady.
Love is the reason that makes him sick
When it takes so long for him to see his miss.

Even if he had no good voice. for her pleasure, he will sing.
Even If he becomes weak. To fight for her, he will still hold his sling.
He says "senorita, be my one and only Inamorata"
Let me take you to italia in the finest of regalia.
