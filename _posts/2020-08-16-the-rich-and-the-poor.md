The rich will be praised by all men.
All day long, the wealthy listens to many hymns of praise.
Who cares if they are foolish or wise,able or disable?

Their feet are showered with kisses and their buttocks are sooted with baby oil.
The rich passes by, all heads and eyes turn to see
They fly on the wings of money and swim in the pool of luxury.
Do wealth come to only the determined and hardworker?
Do riches also come by fate and goodluck?

People who are poor are despised, even by their neighbors.
All day long, they listen to hunger rhythms and the scorn of men.
Who cares if they are foolish or wise, able or disable?

Their feet are meant to run pitiable errands and their buttocks freeze solid-rock at the remembrance of their debts.
The poor passes by and are unnoticed, they are like faces hidden behind a dark mask.
They crawl on shame and bask in the sun of misery
Do poverty come to only the undetermined and lazy?
Are the poor just ill fated and enriched with bad luck?
Are there any hardworkers amongst them?
Do the wise also go hungry?

Answer me this riddle
In a world filled with the rich and poor
The goat still bleats and the lion roars
If Billy the goat eats the poor grass, what does Leo feeds on?
But then i saw a rich man and a poor man who were close and best of friends.
I saw everything is made to be good when they come in pairs.
