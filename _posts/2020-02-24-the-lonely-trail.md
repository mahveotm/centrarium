I'm all alone in here   
Alone I face every fear  
Journeying thro' wonderland each day  
In the silence I lay at Bay  
No one sees my plight  
None to switch the light  

My mind,my most visited circus  
Loneliness my very real status  
Crying my well played part  
Smiling my most enjoyed art  
My pains I share with myself  
Stored up as tho in a shelf  
 
None seems cool enough  
As they will spill it  in a cough  
You may say I keep my secret  
But I say I'm simply discreet  
You may voice "I play proud"  
But I echo "I hate it loud"  

Skillful in playing it  as courtesy   
Deep within I fathom it's anxiety  
Anxious that evil be not met    
Frightened of the tale of regret  
From several tongues I have heard  
Never wish that from my lips it be said  

I encamp myself by self  
And honourably shield self in a shelf  
One I'm often so eager to set free   
But yet I reach afar to it's palmtree  
I long to see her dance around  
And do enjoy not being bound  

Often Caught amidst thoughts  
Presenting to myself the many buts  
Realistically projecting the why's  
Considerably analysing them lies    
Lies I know they are, all in a shell  
Sailing me nowhere but in a cell  

I still refuse to admit that I'm bound  
Cos I obviously do tour around  
My questions remain unasked   
My pains and hurt always masked  
My tales I will rather not share  
Cos I'm lonely everywhere!!!
