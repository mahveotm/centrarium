Once, I knew I'm the leader of tomorrow
I aspire to earn the future that's borrowed
And hijacked by the older generation
As we suffer and wander In condemnation

You're the leader of tomorrow I say is myth
Hunger,thirst and poverty we reckon with
Our bones scrawny due to malnutrition
In  misery we strive with a blurry vision

Leaders of tomorrow we were told
Into slavery,and illiteracy we're sold
A forgotten leader with jeopardize future
Shattered dreams and lost aspirations


You're a forgotten leader with no future
Ripped of our own right we lost ourmission
Drenched in poverty I lost my aspirations
And became same with the Nation

Leaders they say are made not born
In readiness and preparedness we await the morrow that never comes
The best heritage and legacy is lost
The only weapon I had education
Fades as my hope dwiddle


 we're deprived of our birth right.
The leaders of tomorrow are forgotten 
 I hate to say there's no future to hold on to
As there dreams have been shattered
