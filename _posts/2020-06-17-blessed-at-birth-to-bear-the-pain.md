The drip of blood is an inspiration to live
With courage in my heart I  move
Sacred are the unspoken word of a mother 
A chord  binding  us together forever

In agony she labor that I may breath
Broken and chastised she keeps moving
Fasted and prayed that I may survive
Lonely,she strife the path to give meaning

A mother, she works ahead her fear
Like Abraham without a destination
The emptiness in makes her longing
The hardship for her child she bear

The scars utter more than she speak
She is but a silenced mother finding,
Comfort in her jagged and tamed voice
In all she climbs the ladder with valor
Strengthen by the future she carry
She's blessed at birth to bear the pain
