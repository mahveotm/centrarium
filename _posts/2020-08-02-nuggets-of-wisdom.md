In a careful analysis of the nature of man, 
God, the world, the seen and unseen, 
this temporal realm spanning the beginning to the end 
and our going to and fro our daily activities of diverse manners..

I have come to discover something about it all, 
I have discovered it is all a mystery. 
Indeed the wise discovers many things about all things 
but God has used all things to hide the main thing and why is this? 

To prove a purpose, which also is a mystery itself.
Now i would say with God given wisdom that it seems God(Perfection) has used all things 
to hide Himself(Perfection) and to only prove Himself (His Characters like Love, sorrow, Mercy, Justice, Wisdom, truth, joy,Fatherliness, righteousness, grief etc). 
Now why should God prove Himself, what does it matter anyway? Simply because He is God, *He must be *! 

Also,Like a deja vu, man is also proving himself(character make up. 
for even in Christ, believers all grow out to different flavors), man is proving himself that either he loves the light(truth) or darkness(deceit/lies) and in the end, 
then *we will be*. This i know for sure, that the totality/comprehension of God is beyond us and we are in deep darkness/lost and that our only light is the Word of God and His Spirit.
