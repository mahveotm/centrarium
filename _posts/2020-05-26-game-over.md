Now my heart is deserted 
Now it feels like my whole world is falling apart
How do I heal from this mess??
I ruined it all.


Now I’m stucked in my bed
Staring at nothing
Stucked in my own thought and weeping
Sadness, anger and anxiety stalk my days and nights 
I can feel frozen blood in my veins.


Now I’m staring in the mirror 
Asking God 
What was my fault?
Why me?

Now my heart is torn apart 
Not crushed, 
Not shattered but
RIPPED!!

And now I ask my self ,
Is this a game over????
