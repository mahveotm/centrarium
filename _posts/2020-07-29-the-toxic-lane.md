Behold he yells "sit  here!"
Despite Thorns being there
Our dear Care is no more
 Popular Love has gone sore
Stealing all jewels in the city

Now she's barely coping
Oh! She's merely striving
Mistress of faked smiles
Disher and saucer of lies
Another sentiment to pity!!

Manages each event,
Accustomed to every effect
In a jiffy, a stranger to self
You look up to YOU, as an elf 
To freedom he longs to reach

Gradually settling for lesser'
Obviously deserving better,
Yet too scared to take a dare
Every chance she dashes mere'
True expression only at the beach.

Each step, a mere custom
In a well, deep at it's bottom
Singing the lines like mere rhymes'
Tasting it's fruit like sour limes
 His part does well to bore!

Her most displayed art, mimics!
Yet comprehends not the lyrics
Now nothing sounds melodious, 
Gaze stolen by the rebellious;
Tho' She is meant for more!

Why wear sadness like an attire?
Choosing your life to pose a satire
Why place all values to only cope?
The theme song hammers hope
Yet the character  mourn.

A need to take a walk,
Enough of the petty talk!
This hypocrisy  to stop!
This madness to halt his hop!
To face life right at its horn!!
