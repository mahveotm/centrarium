Across me is Billy Jones, a ravaging mentally deranged patient.
I despise his lunatics 
I hate every bit of it!

Is insanity not a disease of the mind?
Buttered with weirdness and a toast to schizophrenia.

He sits on the floor and sits the chair on his head.
He whispers and then suddenly screams out as though taken over by a demon.
He sees things and then he doesn't see anything at all in the whole universe.

Three hours, I have kept silent as the grave yard and as still as the dead, watching every crazy move of his.
I can't take it no more!
It is because i laugh hard while i shed tears,
that they say I'm a lunatic.
Am i a lunatic? 
I ask again, am i as mad as Billy Jones.

It's unfair that I'm always locked alone in a padded cell.
When the doctor comes, i shall tell him i am a lawyer and i will skillfully defend my rights.
If that fails, i shall be another Clark Kent and fight my way to freedom!.
