I miss him

I miss his smile 
He captures joy with those beautiful smile.
His smile,

Is like a row of tombstone reflecting in a pont 

I miss him

I miss his eyes 
I’d miss a thousand sunset just to look at his eyes.
His eyes,

Deep as the ocean 
As dreamy as a starry light
As innocent as a child’s laughter.

His sharp gaze
As if lined with shards of glass around the edges.

I miss him

I miss his lips
The perfect symmetry along the Cupid bow
Looks like “God” was drunk when he made him.
His lips,

The way his lips brushes mine 
Softly, delicately like butterfly wings.

I miss him

I miss his voice 
So warm
So cozy like a blanket that wraps around me.
His voice,

Full of emotions 
Sweet mellifluous voice
Sounds like heaven flowing down to earth.

I miss him

I miss his dimples
When he winks 
His dimples,

When he twinkles with humor his dimples appear.

I miss him BUT,
I think I’m the only one caught in this missing game.

I miss him BUT,
He doesn’t miss me like I do!!!!
