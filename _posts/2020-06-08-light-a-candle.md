Don't look for the problems of Africa in her streets.
Neither look for it in her markets or In a far away land of some enemies.
Our problems are right in our minds.

You blame the man who stole our lands and put our people into slavery
You ask for the heads of the cheats that exchanged mirrors and some bottles of gin for hectres  of land
But what should we do to the man who rounded his brothers up and sold them into slavery for dane gun and gun powder and parted his land for mirrors and and gin.

If you think this was in the past i am sorry your lens must be misty. 
Today Africans are still deligently and devotedly emptying their treasure house for phony rewards.

Our leaders are leading the way with multitude streaming and cotoeing with them to the slaughter slab smiling, rejoicing and some in outright frenzy
Some are weeping not because they know the doom ahead but because they are far behind in the queue. 
Now is the time to illuminate our darkness we have cursed darkness long enough Let's light a candle . 

Darkness hears only light, our hearts are groping in pitch darkness. 
They are thirsting for light.

LIGHT A CANDLE  AFRICA !
