I hope one day  
I will wrap myself in my blanket again, with no worries or fear patting my back  
I will swing my little feet again, not minding the dust on its wears  
I will dip my feet in the mud again, not stung by elitism's venom  
I will flaunt my brown thirty two's again, not bottling the tiniest hurt  
I will take each step again, not crippled by tomorrow's slightest ill fate  

I hope one day,  
I will march again, not scared of the fiercest drought or the tiniest wave  
I will let my lachrima gland release it's droplets when I'm hurt again, and let go off the hurt right there  
I will bark again when I'm bitten, never to veil my wounds  
I will dive in the waters again to the borders of my heightened aspirations, with the strongest of beliefs  
I will speak of my insecurities, and not mask my mounting fears  

I hope one day,  
I will give my heart out again, without fear or unsafety;   
I will open my ears to words again, with an open mind; and hearken to wise words  
I will believe in the unstoppable Me, never to doubt the power residing in me  
I will walk through the thorns again, never to  run from it's gross piercings  
 I will jump high to the sky, free of the many burdens  

I hope one day,  
I will live as a child again!!
