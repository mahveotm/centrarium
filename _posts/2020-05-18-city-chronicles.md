In the city, where time flies so fast.  
One begins to ponder, what have I done all through my life, but to effortlessly swim on to wherever the tides of the city take me.  

In the city, where mostly strangers live amongst each other.  
We are all strangers in the city, this big whole city which swallows your dream and you clearly couldn't do a damn about it, for its the most ruthless of the villain.  

In the city, where opportunities are like astronomical anomalies.  
Too good to be true, fear of being a prey to the city's henchmen (society's no-gooders), hell who wants to be one (a prey), everyone wishes to be the apex predator in the harsh game of survival of the fittest.  

In the city, where generations upon generations reside.  
Seeking greater pastures in the city with the torrent of young individuals migrating, pouring their blood and sweat into the city by creating essentials like bridges, roads, buildings, railways and so on.  
Yet only to be forgotten in time, I mean who effing cares who built it as long as it has its uses.  

In the city, where the seven great sins dwell unanimously.  
(Greed,sloth,lust,envy,wrath,gluttony and pride)feeding their unquenchable thirst with the souls of every mortal residing in the city.  
For only those in the practice of the seven virtues can repel them(chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness and humility).  
But alas, I highly doubt that there are souls worthy enough to take into practice all seven virtues, maybe a few in the whole of the earth.  

In the city, where corruption has taken roots.  
Stemming from every angle of its vicinity, strong solid roots, one begins to wonder when was the corrosive seed planted.  
Bewildering, for its as old as time itself and shall be till eternity.  
So i ask how long is eternity? for anything eternal surely has an end.
