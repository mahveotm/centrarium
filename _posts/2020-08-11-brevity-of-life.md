After the day's hectic journey,
Old roger slept.
He blanketed himself with the soil 
He dreamt that he never again awoke.
He slumbered just as all shall slumber.

He was an infant in the morning,
Foolish and pampered.
He was young and free at noon
Vibrant,energetic and an epitome of beauty.
He was a shaky old bone at dusk,
He had lost his swagger,his cherished beauty faded and he wrinkled.

What was all the labour for ?
Good or bad, he is asleep in a box
Mighty or a chicken, he is 6feet below.
His life was like a currency and he had spent it all.

So what matters?
Nothing will for old roger
What matters?
A life well spent unto others,
For in the very end, our own lives to us will not matter so much.
