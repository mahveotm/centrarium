Samael, he who is said to be gifted by his Father's own will,begins to question his Father's grand plan.He looks onwards towards his Father's Creation,majestically constructed in Glorified Intent,he gaze upon the constructs with eyes as fiery as flames,hair seemingly long and red in comparison to his other brothers.
 His dreaded thoughts begin to ooze out of him,staining the Haven in which he stands,knowing full well his thoughts are being read by his Father but his strong determination could care not much of it.
 Michael,ever calm like the eastern breeze,soft in words and character,eyes comforting and lain with sky blue complexity,hair long and golden as smooth as silk.In his solemn space ever distant from his other brothers except samael,in which they both grow some kind of attachment between one another.
 Michael mostly called upon by his Father to relay instructions to his brothers,this said instructions doesn't often occur,it could be an interval of months,years,centuries.He is said to innate his Father's Demiurgic Powers.
 Samael sought for his brother Michael,they both exchanged greetings as they often do when they cross path.
 Then Michael asked “Oh brother why have you come to my presence this day”
Samael replied “I have come for an issue has been craving action within me for a time now brother”
“What issue is this you speak of?” Michael asked
Sameal replied “I wish to be of my own volition”
“What blasphemous words are you spewing brother,it is not of us to indulge ourselves in any manner of our choosing except Father's choosing roles” Michael retorted
“But He could give gift of freewill to those lesser beings of muddy clay and not to us His First” Samael replied
Michael answered “Oh brother we are of no objection to our Father's plan ”
“Michael,will you stand by me when i make my keen stand on our Father's creation?” Samael asked
Michael replied “No,oh brother of mine,you ought to seek penance for the calamity of sacrilege and i shall speak to father in your stead ”
Samael looked at his brother with intense gaze and nod his head in contempt of him not standing by him,and then he stretched his wings with one flap he took off in disappointment.
Michael went to the Tower Of Divinity, where he mostly receives instructions from his Father,He hasn't called upon him but The Most Omniscient knows what troubles his son to have sought for him,and also the outcome of what shall transpire in time.
Michael knelt at The Presence and said “Father i know not of what to do,for my strength is Yours to will it as You may”
The Presence replied with a benevolent tune that sounds entirely out of existence “GO FORTH MY SON FOR YOU KNOW WHAT MUST BE”.Michael stood up and left his Father's Presence,gathering Haven's Legion to confront his brother Samael.
Thus,engaged in battle with Samael and his fellow confidant who supports his ideology,they number in the several thousands.Michael unravel his Demiurgic power against the one's who were once his brothers,infused with The Almighty Blessing of his Father.
This battle will be known by all as “The Great Fall”, relating to the fall of Samael and his confidant during their rebellion,exiling them to The Underworld while falling millions of leagues from Haven to Hell as their Angelic wings burn into ash from their back.
Samael,renouncing his name to Lucifer(The morninstar,The Lightbringer),with Infinite Will blessed to him by his Father during his creation.He went ahead to proclaim himself The Taunting King Of The Damned with his fellow brothers now turned Demons.
Michael once again at The presence of his Father asked “why Father, why did this transpire?”
The presence answered “IT WAS MEANT TO BE”.
